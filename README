LITL - Linked list, input, timer, library

This library includes:
- Timer (Can work in interrupt mode or system time mode, configure in castimer.h). Functions: value() - returns value and starts timer ; 
  reset() - resets the timer
  The timer can work either on system  time or an interrupt, where you get the bonus of adding a function hook to the timer (when creating the timer you give it a function, calling period, and a function parameter, the timer will then call this function every given period. If the first parameter is NULL, then the timer will operate in normal mode and just return the value)
  , when using the hook the timer will auto reload. (Everything is described in the castimer.hh)

- Input - Controls inputs of the atmega mcu, includes optional timed filtering (requires the castimer). Functions: vrednost() - returns value of input; risingEdge() - returns 1 if input has risen (edge gets cleared only after the call, or if input is unpressed); Falling edge- returns 1 if input has fallen. NOTE! Input class constructor accepts pin, port and unpressed state of the input. If the third (unpressed state) parameter is set to 1, the input object will return inverted value of what the PIN register is actually reading.

- Linked list - Linked list library that doesn't use a constructor so it can be used by timer class (and it is). Functions: dodaj_konec() - adds element to the back of the list; dodaj_zacetek() - adds element to the front of the list; cisti_seznam() - removes all the elements from the list;
length() - returns the amount of elements in the list.
NOTE! To access the elements in linked list, use  "object_name [index]". Do not reverse index and object_name as this is not a pointer but an operator overload funtion.
